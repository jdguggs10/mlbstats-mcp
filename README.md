### üöÄ Integration with Sports-Proxy

When used with the enhanced sports-proxy, the workflow becomes seamless:

```python
# User input: "Get the Yankees roster"
# 1. Sports-proxy detects MLB sport
# 2. Extracts tools: resolve_team("yankees"), get_team_roster({})
# 3. MLB MCP resolves: resolve_team ‚Üí {id: 147}
# 4. Sports-proxy enriches: get_team_roster({teamId: "147"})
# 5. MLB MCP returns: Complete roster data
```

This eliminates the need for manual entity resolution and creates a natural language interface to MLB data!
